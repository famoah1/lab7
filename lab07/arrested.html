            <h2>Arrested</h2>
            <p>During this campaign, King's arrest for driving just slightly above the speed limit, at 30 mph in a 25 mph zone, unexpectedly attracted nationwide media attention, significantly boosting his public image as a civil rights leader. While the incident itself seemed minor, it served as a stark example of the systemic racism faced by African Americans on a daily basis, leading to widespread public outrage and support for the civil rights cause.The media coverage shed light on the broader issues of racial injustice and segregation, helping to galvanize public opinion in favor of civil rights. This incident highlighted the urgency of addressing discriminatory practices in the South, making it a turning point in the civil rights movement.Following King's arrest, the United States District Court issued a landmark ruling in Browder v. Gayle, putting an end to racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. This legal victory marked a significant milestone in the fight for civil rights, as African Americans gained the full legal right to sit wherever they pleased on public buses, ultimately breaking down the racial barriers that had persisted for so long. King's pivotal role in this campaign elevated him to national prominence and solidified his position as a prominent civil rights leader, inspiring many to join the struggle for equality and justice.</p>

            <h3>Quote</h3>
            <p>"<em>In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men – yes, black men as well as white men – would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.… America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.'</em>" --Martin Luther King Jr </p>
