            <p>Dr. King, a leader for all people, never chose fear over courage and determination when fighting for civil rights in the face of injustice, ignorance, and violence. He refused to let prison, assault, or the possibility of death influence his final objective. Instead, he stood by his goal of obtaining universal human rights through nonviolent protests.</p>
            <p>Dr. King envisioned a more diverse America in which everyone could experience the benefits of <strong>equality</strong>. During a time when the opposition was enacting legislation that denied people of color their rights and expressing hatred through beatings and killings, Dr. King continued to choose the high road. He recognized that violence would play into the opposition's plan. He was well aware that violent vengeance would precisely fit the stereotype that many had constructed of civil rights militants. As a result, he was continually preaching that nonviolence would eventually allow the opposition to win.</p>
            <p>Dr. King also recognized the need to unite the masses in pursuit of a single purpose. Separately, making any major progress would be difficult. Collectively, he and other civil rights advocates could influence laws and change across the country. Dr. King's leadership aided the overall success of the civil rights movement in the mid-1900s and continues to have an impact on <em>civil rights movements today</em>.</p>
            <p>After years of campaigning by activists, members of Congress, and Coretta Scott King, among others, in 1983 President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a U.S. federal holiday in honor of King. Observed on the third Monday of January, Martin Luther King Day was first celebrated in 1986.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Gifted at a young age:</h3>
                <p>King skipped two grades and entered college at the age of 15. He was admitted to Morehouse College in 1944 and graduated in 1948 with a B.A. in Sociology at the age of 19. The Morehouse president, Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, became an inspirational figure in Kingâ€™s life.</p>

                <h3>Surviving an assassination:</h3>
                <p>On September 20, 1958, King was attending a book signing at a Blumstein's department store in Harlem when a young woman approached him. Izola Ware Curry, the woman, inquired whether he was Martin Luther King Jr., and when he said yes, she thrust a seven-inch letter opener into his chest. Curry claimed she had been looking for him for five years, assuming he had Communist Party affiliations.</p>

                <h3>The truth about his death:</h3>
                <p>Overwhelming evidence showed James Earl Ray was not the shooter but was set up to take the blame. After the evidence showed Ray did not pull the trigger, local, state, and federal U.S government agencies, and the Mafia were to blame. The King family was awarded $100, which they donated to charity. To them, it was never about the money; they just wanted the truth out, and for justice to be served.</p>
